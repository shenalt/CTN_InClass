    <h1>Class 7: Use loops to calculate vote difference</h1>
    <h2>Goal: Using loops, calculate the vote difference from 2020 to 2024 for each candidate, add to a new array, and <code>console.log()</code> them with a function. Should look something like this:</h2>
    <code>Kamala Harris won Manhattan with 82.4% of the vote, about 65 points more than Donald Trump, who had 17.6%. Harris has 169,509 more votes than Biden in 2020.</code>
    <h3>Things to keep in mind</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You'll have to do some mathmatical calculations and <code>.push()</code> to add to the new array.</li>
        <li>The function on line 84 should NOT be touched -- you'll need to write a loop to populate it with your new array.</li>
        <li>Make sure your variables and props are spelled correctly!</li>

    </ul>
